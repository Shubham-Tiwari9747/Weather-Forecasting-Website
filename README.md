Get real time weather update 
We have developed the system in such a way that it can be used efficiently
by all the users. Let’s Assume all the webpages and logics related to admin
and usersas separate modules. We have two modules and each of these
modules havetheir own unique functions. Important thing is that it is not
designed for particular type peoples. This application can help all the users
to access the weather report details through internet or intranet that means
anytime and anywhere. We wanted to create a tool that fits into modern age,
but still stays true to the “concepts of studying”. So, this process also helps
in maintaining consistency and integrity.
